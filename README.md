# credit-risk-classification

I had to work my head around the classification report in regards to class 0 and 1, but otherwise not too difficult. The exercise helped me understand how an imbalanced dataset can be detrimental in training a model and some of the methods to combat it. Submission was late due to me misremembering the submission deadline, sorry!! 

Relevant ML code was taken from previous in-class challenges and modified for the assignment. ROS code is from the imbalanced-learn doc.
